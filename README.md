# HTR-Frontend
This is a proof of concept for a HTR-Frontend using the Transkribus API.

It works with sapper&svelte. Though in the future, sapper will not be neccessary. It was used in a early stage to create a server-route that does the login with a predefined user.

Since I started working on this, Transkribus has released it's own Web-App called [Transkribus-Lite](https://transkribus.eu/lite). This repo is therefore more or less obsolete.

## TODO

- Organise in seperate components
- create export-job and download-PDF-Button
