# HTR-Frontend
This is a proof of concept for a HTR-Frontend using the Transkribus API.

It works with sapper&svelte. Though in the future, sapper will not be neccessary. It was used in a early stage to create a server-route that does the login with a predefined user.

## TODO

- oAuth Login
- Clean up code
- Organise in seperate components
- build the project svelte-only (since no sapper-features are used)
- create export-job and download-PDF-Button
